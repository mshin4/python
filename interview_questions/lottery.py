'''Let's write a simple function that will help organise lotteries. The function will generate a list of random numbers (to simulate lottery tickets), and it will also choose one number from the generated list (to simulate the winning ticket).
Write a function named generate_tickets that will accept two integer arguments: ticket_count and max_number. The function should return a tuple with exactly two elements:
first element: a list of random unique integer numbers in the range from 0 (inclusive) to max_number (exclusive); the number of elements is provided in the ticket_count argument
second element: one random element from the generated list of numbers
Calling generate_tickets(5, 10) should generate 5 random unique integers in the range from 0 (inclusive) to 10 (exclusive). An example return value for this invocation could be:
([2, 8, 9, 3, 0], 8)
In this case, the random numbers are: 2, 8, 9, 3, 0. The winning number is 8.
Note: You can assume that the arguments of the function are always correct (i.e. you always get two correct integers as the input arguments).'''

##TODO using random module, generate a list of random numbers and randomly pick a winning numbef from that list


##ANSWER
# import random
#
# def generate_tickets(ticket_count, max_number):
#     number_list = random.sample(range(0,max_number), ticket_count)
#     return(number_list, random.sample(number_list, 1)[0])
